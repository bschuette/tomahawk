                Note - This component is different to others, it uses Ajax mechanisms
                to fetch preview data from the server, thus the backend binding can
                and will be used outside of the standard JSF lifecycle to deliver the data.
                
                <br/><br/>
                Description of the call order:<br/> 
                <code>
                control -&gt; Ajax request -&gt; suggestionMethod in backend bean -&gt; values pushed into the control binding -&gt; result sent back to the client -&gt; control shows suggestion drop down
                </code>
                <br/><br/>
                On the backend side, a callback method - the suggestion method, has to be implemented, 
                which is called by the Ajax request and
                fetches the data from a data source. The data then is pushed into the control binding similarly
                to drop down menus and other controls which use the SelectItem object as data holder.
                The rest is done automatically.
